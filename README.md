2. Facility Use - this covers the functionalities of managing the facility such as reserving a facility; the cost of using and maintaining it; assigning and de-assigning a facility for use.
3. Facility maintenance – this functionality covers the maintenance of a facility such as scheduling a facility for maintenance; checking maintenance status; listing maintenance requests; calculating down time of a facility and many more functionalities.
